# description

Burauza no Akachan is a virtual pet you take care of directly in your browser. Name your pet, feed them and clean up after them, your akachan is just like owning a real pet.

We used two different APIs Kayne.rest & Moment.JS. Our CSS Framework is called NES.CSS to give an 8-bit feel. We also utilized Bootstrap. Used CSS to write a sprite animation.

# user story

You've been wanting a pet, but you don't have the time or money. You also grew up in the 90's and remember those awesome key chains Tomagatchi! You are taking the bus home and see an ad for Burauza no Akachan and are intrigued. It is a free app that lets you create your very own virtual pet.

### Future Direction

In the future we hope to create more sprites to give users more options of their Burazua no Akachan to give a more personalized game for each user. The idea of having the babies grow and change is also on the horizon.
